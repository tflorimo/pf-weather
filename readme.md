### As seen in the AsmrProg Youtube Channel.

In order to improve my web development skills I replicated this simple project with minor tweaks and added a bit of my own coding style, such as using a different weather API than the one in the video, coding different behaviours for the application and more.

If you want to find the original web application, you can click [here to watch it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC_DtdhH-J4).

The color palette was created with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

I've used [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for getting weather information.

### ToDo:
- Expand this readme with some insights of this web application.
- Explain config.example.js as a way of replicating .env in Javascript.
